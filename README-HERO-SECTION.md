# Hero Video Section Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully redesigned the hero section to include an attractive video background with modern styling that integrates seamlessly with the website's design.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. HTML Structure
- **New hero section** with video background support
- **Fallback image** for browsers that don't support video
- **Interactive elements**: Call-to-action buttons, video play button, scroll indicator
- **Responsive design** with proper Bootstrap grid integration

### 2. CSS Styling (`assets/css/main.css`)
- **Modern video background** with full-screen coverage
- **Gradient overlay** with brand colors (#4b8ef1, #5b68eb, #28e1fd)
- **Glass morphism effects** for buttons with backdrop blur
- **Animated elements**: Pulsing play button, floating elements, shimmer text effects
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **Performance optimizations** including reduced motion support

### 3. JavaScript Functionality (`assets/js/hero-video.js`)
- **Video loading management** with fallback handling
- **Smooth scrolling** for navigation
- **Intersection Observer** for performance optimization
- **Parallax effects** on desktop (disabled on mobile for performance)
- **Loading animations** and error handling

## Required Video Files

To complete the implementation, you need to add video files to the `assets/videos/` directory:

### Video Specifications
- **Primary video**: `hero-video.mp4` (recommended format)
- **Alternative format**: `hero-video.webm` (for better browser support)
- **Recommended dimensions**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (looping)
- **File size**: Keep under 10MB for optimal loading
- **Content**: Should relate to app development, technology, or your brand

### Fallback Image
- **Location**: `assets/images/hero-fallback.jpg`
- **Dimensions**: 1920x1080 or similar aspect ratio
- **Purpose**: Shows when video fails to load or on slow connections

5. **Optimize video files** for web delivery

## Customization Options

### Colors
The hero section uses CSS custom properties that can be easily modified:
- Primary: `#4b8ef1` (blue)
- Secondary: `#5b68eb` (purple)
- Accent: `#28e1fd` (cyan)

### Content
Update the following in `index.html`:

The implementation is now complete and ready for use with your video content!
